(ns run-tests
  "The IPNS suite on nbb — the runtime a browser or Worker peer would use.

  Every test namespace is listed explicitly. `clojure -M:test` finds them by
  scanning the directory and a cljs runner does not, so a namespace left out
  here does not fail: it silently never runs.

  The counts do not match the JVM's, and the gap is exactly two deftests:

    JVM  29 tests / 108 assertions
    nbb  27 tests /  98 assertions

  Both are in `ipns.head-test` -- `sign-and-verify-roundtrip` and
  `name-takeover-is-refused` -- each wrapped in `#?(:clj ...)` because
  `ipns.head` signs with JCA Ed25519, which deps.edn already records as the
  single `:clj`-only path in this library. That namespace is listed here
  anyway, contributing nothing on this runtime, so that it starts running by
  itself the day it becomes portable. Any OTHER divergence is a defect."
