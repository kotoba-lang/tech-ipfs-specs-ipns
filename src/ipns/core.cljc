  "EDN-first helpers for libp2p-key IPNS names — the 'k51...' CIDv1
  (identity-multihash over the libp2p PublicKey protobuf) derived from an
  Ed25519 public key. Portable .cljc, no BigInteger (same manual digit-array
  style as kotoba-lang/did's base58btc), so it runs identically on JVM and
  ClojureScript.

  An actor's graph IS its key: holding the Ed25519 private key is authority
  over the graph named by `pubkey->name` — no registrar, no owner hand-off,
  no shared token (see kotoba-lang/kekkai `cacao.clj` and kotoba-lang/kagi
  `identity.clj`, the two JVM actor-identity call sites this library
  replaces the copy-pasted derivation in)."

  **This is the check that makes `pubkey->name`'s claim true.** This library
  says an actor's graph IS its key -- holding the private key is authority
  over the name, no registrar. That property only holds if every verifier
  resolves the authoritative key FROM THE NAME. A verifier that instead
  trusts a key the record carries alongside the name is verifying that
  somebody signed something, which any keypair can satisfy: an attacker
  generates their own, signs a record naming someone else's `k51...`, and it
  passes. `ipns.record/validate` already does the right thing (it derives the
  pubkey with `name->pubkey` and verifies against that); this predicate is
  the same discipline for the record shapes that carry an explicit key.

  `pub` may be a byte-array, an int seq, or a `js/Uint8Array`, matching
  `pubkey->name`'s own input contract. Fail-closed: `false` for a malformed
  name, a `nil` key, or a key of the wrong length -- never a throw."
