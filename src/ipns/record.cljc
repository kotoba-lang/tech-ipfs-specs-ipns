(ns ipns.record
  "The **real IPNS Record** (specs.ipfs.tech/ipns/ipns-record) — the signed,
  protobuf-encoded value that Kubo, Helia and every other IPFS implementation
  puts into and reads out of the libp2p DHT.

  This is not the same thing as `ipns.head`. That namespace signs a
  kotobase-shaped map (`{:name :value :sequence :valid_until}`) for
  kotobase.net's own XRPC registry, and no IPFS implementation can validate it.
  Publishing those bytes to the DHT would put a record on the network that
  every peer rejects. So the record format has to be right *before* the
  transport question is even interesting — which is why this namespace exists
  and why `ipns.head` is now documented as the local-registry format it always
  was.

  ## The record

  A protobuf `IpnsEntry` whose interesting field is `data` — a DAG-CBOR map —
  and whose signature covers that CBOR, not the protobuf:

      signatureV2 = sign(privkey, \"ipns-signature:\" || data)

  The other protobuf fields (`value`, `validity`, `validityType`, `sequence`,
  `ttl`) are a **duplicate** of what is inside `data`, kept for readers that
  predate V2. That duplication is the sharp edge: a validator must check the
  two copies agree, because a record whose protobuf says one thing and whose
  signed CBOR says another is a record that reads differently depending on
  which half you look at. Signing only the CBOR and then rewriting the
  protobuf half is precisely the attack the check exists to stop.

  ## What is injected

  Signing and verification, as `sign-fn` / `verify-fn`. Same reason as
  `org-ietf-dnssec`: a library that imported an Ed25519 implementation would
  need somewhere for the private key to be, and the key belongs in the caller's
  keystore. It also makes every byte-level assertion testable without crypto —
  the test suite's signer returns its input.

  ## Scope

  Ed25519 names only (`k51…`), which is what `ipns.core` derives and what
  every modern IPNS name is. RSA names carry their public key in the `pubKey`
  field because it does not fit in an identity multihash; that path is
  documented as absent rather than half-built."
